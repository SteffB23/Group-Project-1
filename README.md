SO THAT I can ensure they eat
```
GIVEN I am ordering a lunch meal:
WHEN I load the form, I am presented with a food menu 
WHEN I enter my Id and email 
THEN I should be able to access the main menu 
WHEN I'm in the main menu 
THEN I will be able to choose something from the menu 
WHEN I choose something from the menu 
THEN I should have an option to add more details
WHEN my order is completed 
THEN I can place my order (submit)
WHEN my order is ready
I SHOULD receive an alert "Your food is ready".
